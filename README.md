# AI-ML-360
A comprehensive AI-powered retail analytics suite covering supervised &amp; unsupervised learning, time series forecasting, recommender systems, reinforcement learning, NLP, computer vision, explainable AI, fairness, and generative AI with advanced RAG-based multi-turn QA — built using a unified dataset for all modules.


This project also is an advanced, end-to-end AI & Machine Learning retail analytics suite designed to simulate real-world retail business intelligence tasks, including predictive modeling, personalization, explainability, and generative AI with advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
